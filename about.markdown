I'm Aitor, a cybersecurity professional from Spain with experience in Red Teaming, APT emulation, advanced pentesting, offensive tool development, and large-scale vulnerability management.

Over the years, Iâ€™ve worked with international organizations in highly regulated environments, leading technical projects and offensive campaigns to evaluate and strengthen their security posture.

My approach combines real-world offensive techniques with threat intelligence, frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK, and a high level of automation. I've had the opportunity to conduct complex simulations and attacks and work closely with defensive teams.

This blog is a space where I share research, insights, and lessons learned from a practical, hands-on perspective in offensive security and tactical risk management.
